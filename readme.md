# Algorithms and Data Structures I - Course Projects

## Description
This repository contains the projects developed for the **Algorithms and Data Structures I** course. The assignments cover algorithm efficiency analysis, data structures such as stacks, and tree-based calculations. The projects are implemented in **Python** and **Java**.

## Assignments and Implementations

### 1. **Operation Counting Analysis (Python) - `trab1.py`**
- Implements different algorithms and measures their performance using **operation counting**.
- Determines whether algorithms follow polynomial or exponential growth.
- Uses Python's `matplotlib` to generate **graphs** of algorithm complexity.
- **Key Algorithms:**
  - Fibonacci sequence with recursion.
  - Multiple nested loops with varying complexities.
  - Exponential and polynomial function detection.

### 2. **Complex Number Stack-Based Calculator (Python) - `main.py`, `pilha.py`**
- Implements a **stack-based calculator** for complex numbers.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Additional operations: **inverse (`inv`), absolute value (`abs`), swap (`swap`), and duplicate (`dup`)**.
- Reads input from a file and executes the operations.

### 3. **Tree Structure Analysis (Java) - `Tree.java`, `TTest.java`**
- Implements a **tree-based model** for evaluating the stability of structures.
- Nodes represent parts of a **monument**, and calculations determine whether it remains **balanced**.
- Includes operations:
  - **Insert nodes (`ins`)**
  - **Calculate height (`alt`)**
  - **Evaluate stability (`kak`)**
  - **Recursive operations (`tudo`)**
- Reads input and dynamically constructs the tree representation.
